      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">January 31, 2019</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
        Introduction I can&rsquo;t say exactly when it all began, but at some point in late 2010/early 2011, I became aware of the brony fandom. My initial reaction was unfortunately typical: &ldquo;What is this?! Well, it&rsquo;s probably going to be like this one meme that just happened (The Big Lebowski re-written in a Shakespearean fashion) and will disappear/be forgotten in a month&rsquo;s time like that one did.&rdquo; When it didn&rsquo;t vanish as I expected, I was more surprised than irritated at being wrong.

      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">January 4, 2019</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
        I got into Doctor Who when Russell T. Davies was the showrunner and David Tennant was the Doctor..at that point, I thought it was delightfully weird and not quite like anything that I&rsquo;d seen before. I wasn&rsquo;t rearranging my schedule to watch it but I had it set to record on my DVR and liked to watch a few in a row if I had the time. Then Steven Moffat took over the show and I noticed things started changing almost immediately.

      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">November 29, 2018</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
        Now that things have (kind of) settled down for me, I want to get my thoughts on the first two songs I&rsquo;ve released written while they&rsquo;re (relatively) fresh in my mind.
Fields of Gold Back in the 90s, I was rather confused musically (along with being confused in general). I was just starting to get into metal after a childhood of almost nothing but classical and the pop music of the day (of course, I still love 80s/early 90s pop if just due to the nostalgia factor) and I was starting to disdain anything that I thought was &lsquo;too light&rsquo; (a lot of which I love now, naturally).

      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">July 30, 2018</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
        I think it was about 10-11 years ago that I started regularly playing Blizzard&rsquo;s seminal MMORPG, World of Warcraft. Back then, I had enormous amounts of free time (that seem mostly wasted, in retrospect) but I did have a lot of fun playing WoW during that time. Of course, as time went on, my life changed significantly for the better but I still tried to fit in playing whenever I could.

      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">June 8, 2018</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
        Several weeks ago, I was randomly looking around Twitter (I know, a wonderful use of one&rsquo;s time) and happened upon a reply in a long thread which stated that &ldquo;(our fandom) has terrible PR.&rdquo; So that got me thinking..and as usual, I thought it over for quite a while and came to the conclusion that (if they weren&rsquo;t just glumly kidding..I have a hard enough time telling if people are doing that in real life, let alone the Internet.

      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">March 5, 2018</h2>
      
      <div class="content">
        This is something I&rsquo;ve been pondering for quite a while, and now is as good a time as any to write it all down.
I&rsquo;ve been around the Internet a long time and I&rsquo;ve seen..well, just about everything (and a lot of things I never wanted to see, but that&rsquo;s life in general). In the early 2000s, I started hanging around political blogs and while I don&rsquo;t remember saying all that much, I felt like I could if I needed to.

      <div class="content">
        One of the biggest changes in going from &ldquo;single guy&rdquo; to &ldquo;family man&rdquo; is that the weekend, once the thing that got one through a tough week, is now..something else entirely. It&rsquo;s not &lsquo;my&rsquo; time anymore, it belongs to my wife and children as well. It was a harsh adjustment at first, of course (especially when the first child arrived and everything changed, but now that I&rsquo;ve set my expectations for what a weekend entails accordingly, I can handle it.

        For when Twitter isn&rsquo;t enough to contain my rants..now there&rsquo;s this site. Also announcements about any songs I&rsquo;ve posted to YouTube..(no ETA on any of those just yet.) Along with anything else I might think of..
