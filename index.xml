      <description>Introduction I can&amp;rsquo;t say exactly when it all began, but at some point in late 2010/early 2011, I became aware of the brony fandom. My initial reaction was unfortunately typical: &amp;ldquo;What is this?! Well, it&amp;rsquo;s probably going to be like this one meme that just happened (The Big Lebowski re-written in a Shakespearean fashion) and will disappear/be forgotten in a month&amp;rsquo;s time like that one did.&amp;rdquo; When it didn&amp;rsquo;t vanish as I expected, I was more surprised than irritated at being wrong.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Doctor Who Season 11</title>

      <description>I got into Doctor Who when Russell T. Davies was the showrunner and David Tennant was the Doctor..at that point, I thought it was delightfully weird and not quite like anything that I&amp;rsquo;d seen before. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t rearranging my schedule to watch it but I had it set to record on my DVR and liked to watch a few in a row if I had the time. Then Steven Moffat took over the show and I noticed things started changing almost immediately.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Fields of Gold and Rainbow</title>

      <description>Now that things have (kind of) settled down for me, I want to get my thoughts on the first two songs I&amp;rsquo;ve released written while they&amp;rsquo;re (relatively) fresh in my mind.
Fields of Gold Back in the 90s, I was rather confused musically (along with being confused in general). I was just starting to get into metal after a childhood of almost nothing but classical and the pop music of the day (of course, I still love 80s/early 90s pop if just due to the nostalgia factor) and I was starting to disdain anything that I thought was &amp;lsquo;too light&amp;rsquo; (a lot of which I love now, naturally).</description>

      <title>Thoughts on World of Warcraft</title>

      <description>I think it was about 10-11 years ago that I started regularly playing Blizzard&amp;rsquo;s seminal MMORPG, World of Warcraft. Back then, I had enormous amounts of free time (that seem mostly wasted, in retrospect) but I did have a lot of fun playing WoW during that time. Of course, as time went on, my life changed significantly for the better but I still tried to fit in playing whenever I could.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on fandoms and public relations</title>

      <description>Several weeks ago, I was randomly looking around Twitter (I know, a wonderful use of one&amp;rsquo;s time) and happened upon a reply in a long thread which stated that &amp;ldquo;(our fandom) has terrible PR.&amp;rdquo; So that got me thinking..and as usual, I thought it over for quite a while and came to the conclusion that (if they weren&amp;rsquo;t just glumly kidding..I have a hard enough time telling if people are doing that in real life, let alone the Internet.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on concern trolls and trolling in general</title>

      <description>This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been pondering for quite a while, and now is as good a time as any to write it all down.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been around the Internet a long time and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen..well, just about everything (and a lot of things I never wanted to see, but that&amp;rsquo;s life in general). In the early 2000s, I started hanging around political blogs and while I don&amp;rsquo;t remember saying all that much, I felt like I could if I needed to.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest changes in going from &amp;ldquo;single guy&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;family man&amp;rdquo; is that the weekend, once the thing that got one through a tough week, is now..something else entirely. It&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;lsquo;my&amp;rsquo; time anymore, it belongs to my wife and children as well. It was a harsh adjustment at first, of course (especially when the first child arrived and everything changed, but now that I&amp;rsquo;ve set my expectations for what a weekend entails accordingly, I can handle it.</description>

      <description>For when Twitter isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to contain my rants..now there&amp;rsquo;s this site. Also announcements about any songs I&amp;rsquo;ve posted to YouTube..(no ETA on any of those just yet.) Along with anything else I might think of..</description>
