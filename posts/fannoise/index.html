      <p>Definitely not Silent Lucidity.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://ghostnotepony.github.io/posts/newtech/">a recent blog post</a>, an issue that I had with my new workstation was that it was making a lot of excessive noise whenever the slightest load would be put on the processor.  I mentioned the <a href="https://www.bequiet.com/en/cpucooler/1659">Dark Rock Slim</a> in the post and that&rsquo;s what I ended up installing.  That install was quite educational and went really well..just took a long time; it involved removing every cable that was plugged in and removing the motherboard itself from the case.  Then, I had to remove the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/cpu-cooler-solution">stock Wraith Prism cooler</a> and its bracket before installing the bracket and cooler for the Dark Rock Slim (along with removing and re-applying thermal paste..)  After reassembling everything, I was surprised that everything worked the first time I booted it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s data I collected on before and after installing the DRS:

<p>Quite the significant difference..especially considering the difference in noise level between 62 and 44 decibels; it&rsquo;s 7.943 times as loud.</p>
<h2 id="stumbling-upon-the-answer-again">Stumbling Upon the Answer (again)</h2>
<p>I thought this was the end of it, but there was still fan noise whenever the CPU temperature went above 50 or so.  Thus, last night, I decided to try to figure out exactly what was going on..for some reason, heh.  I tested the fans I had installed along with the one on the DRS, but it wasn&rsquo;t any of them.  After trying the front fans that came with the case, though, I found that it was 2 of the 3.  Below a certain RPM threshold, they sound fine; the decibel level at mostly idle is 40-41 dB.</p>
<p>The fix that I figured out/stumbled upon was to go into the BIOS and change the fan curve for these two fans only.  What I came up with was to run these fans at &lt;1000 RPM unless the temperature goes to 70C (I don&rsquo;t have any games right now that can get that high..using <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a> to peg at least 12 of the 16 threads is the only way I&rsquo;ve gotten this computer to get that high of a temp.)</p>
<p>So now, running <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/587620/OKAMI_HD/">Okami</a> is 40-41 dB and the CPU doesn&rsquo;t get any hotter than the 61-62 that I recorded in the tables above.  Since decibels are a logarithmic scale, reducing the noise when playing Okami from 62 to 40 dB is a factor of 12.589.   I can also run the 4 thread Stockfish test and it doesn&rsquo;t get any louder as that uses a similar amount of CPU as Okami.</p>
<h2 id="the-question-athoof">The Question at..Hoof?</h2>
<p>Things seem to be fixed now..but the fact that two of the fans on this are (somewhat) defective makes me wonder how long they&rsquo;ll last..and if I should replace these now instead of later.  When I thought about it, though, so long as the CPU is staying cool enough when being utilized (I may be wrong, but the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t get hotter than 80C at 0% CPU idle means to me that no game or other software can go past that..though, if a game really pushed the graphics card, that might create enough heat to push the CPU over the edge..and also create additional noise when the graphic card fans spin up.  Since I only run at 1080p, though, I have no idea if that&rsquo;s even possible..)</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>I think I should let it alone for now..(much as I want to attach another fan to the DRS for even more CPU cooling)..but it is a gift to know..when to stop.</p>
