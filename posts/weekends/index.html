      <p>One of the biggest changes in going from &ldquo;single guy&rdquo; to &ldquo;family man&rdquo; is that the weekend, once <em>the</em> thing that got one through a tough week, is now..something else entirely.  It&rsquo;s not &lsquo;my&rsquo; time anymore, it belongs to my wife and children as well.  It was a harsh adjustment at first, of course (especially when the first child arrived and <em>everything changed</em>, but now that I&rsquo;ve set my expectations for what a weekend entails accordingly, I can handle it.</p>
<p>Most importantly, there is no &ldquo;reset button&rdquo; anymore; there were many weeks during single life where I&rsquo;d work crazy hours and then just hole up in my apartment all weekend long doing very little in the way of anything productive whatsoever.  By Monday morning, I was ready to go at it again and it was easy to cycle that for months at a time.  Life was extremely predictable then and for someone like me, that&rsquo;s quite comforting..but at the same time, it doesn&rsquo;t really go anywhere.</p>
<p>Now, no two weeks run the same at all; there&rsquo;s always something going unexpectedly, a new place to go, a new thing the children are doing as they grow and learn and change so very rapidly.  There&rsquo;s still certain rhythms, certain routines to follow, but otherwise, I have to not expect anything to go exactly as planned and making any concrete plans are bound to fail in some form, way, or shape.  But yet..I&rsquo;m going somewhere, learning more about how to be a better person through my family.  Getting done what I want to get done means just going and doing it instead of making meticulous plans (very much against my grain, but until the kids move out, they come first.).</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if I have more fun making plans than actually executing them, because a plan by itself can never go wrong, but reality makes actually trying them..imperfect.  If I ever want to do what I really want to do, that must change.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to another weekend..</p>
